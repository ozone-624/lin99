# lin99
A pure C99 linear algebra library for type-generic vectors and matrices.

## Languages
C (C99)

## Project
lin99 aims to make creating type-generic linear algebra structures simple by providing a cohesive framework which can be used alongside custom types and memory allocation.  To start working with lin99, simply run build.sh if you're on a UNIX system, or follow these steps:

- Open a folder (name it whatever you want, but "build" is easy to follow)
- Open a terminal in the newly-created folder
- Run these commands:
```
 $ cmake -B . -S ..
 $ cmake --build .
```

Do not use the matrix_t type yet, that is still a work in progress.
